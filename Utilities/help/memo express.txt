Memo Express is a system which helps you in sending or receiving memos (Memoserv). Please note that in DALnet you can't send memo if your nickname is not fully registered & and the nickname that you want to send the memo also. You can set the sound for receiving memo, expired date, etc. Memo Express depends on how is Memoserv works, so if Memoserv is not online (down) that's mean Memo Express doesn't work for sending/receiving memos.
