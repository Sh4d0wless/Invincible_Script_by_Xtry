There are 2 types of Auto ping here.

1) Auto ping to server, it will automatically ping your current server to get the respond. you can set the delay between pings

2) Auto ping to user, it will automatically ping the user who ask for it (type !ping, or say ping me, etc). and send the ping reply back to that user
