Installing SS Email Client

-Just copy the folder Emailer into your main script or normal mirc eg C:\myscript
-then open mirc up and type /load $mircdirEmailer\emailer.mrc

Easy as that

Note: I will let anyone use SS Email Client 1.0 in there script on 1 
condition and that is you DON'T rip it of the author.
