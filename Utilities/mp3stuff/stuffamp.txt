 This is an addon made for mIRC32 v5.8+, designed for use with mp3stuff, my
 other addon.  It can also be used on its own, but with little functionality.
 Winamp skins are used for the player face, and it functions just like winamp.

  The newest changes are listed at the end of this file.

  Thanks

  Thanks to Borut Hrzenjak for letting me include the boamp skin.  You can get
  the full Winamp skin from here:
    http://pages.cthome.net/pdufilie/dl/boamp.wsz

 =====================
  How to use Stuffamp
 =====================
 - Type /load -rs stuffamp.mrc to load the addon.
 - Type /stuffamp to open the player.
 - Right-click in the player window for options.
 - If you have "open on /splay" disabled, you can use the command:
   "stuffamp splay <stuff>" where you would normally just use "splay <stuff>".
   This will open Stuffamp if it isn't already open.
 - Winamp skins may be used with Stuffamp.  Just unzip the skin to a
   directory, right-click in Stuffamp, and you can select that skin.
   [Note]:  Winamp Skin Zip files (*.wsz) are actually .zip files.  Just rename
            the .wsz file to a .zip, and you can unzip it to a directory.

 Controls:
   - You can use the keyboard shortcut keys instead of clicking in the window.
     Hold shift while clicking some buttons to perform the alternate function.

  Hidden features
 =================
   These features might not be obvious if you don't know winamp inside out.

   Window snapping
     - When moving the window, Stuffamp will snap at 16 pixels to the inside
       edges of mIRC if it's inside, or to the outside edges of mIRC and the
       edge of the screen if it's on the desktop.  Hold shift to disable.

   Double-click title bar
     - Switch between normal and windowshade mode.  This is the same as
       clicking the middle of the three buttons in the upper right corner.

   Right-click on time display
     - Shows elapsed/remaining time display options.

   Click & drag songname
     - Scroll the songname manually if it's too long to be displayed.

   Right-click songname
     'Convert underscores to spaces'
       - This will display underscores (_) as spaces when enabled.
     'Autoscroll songname'
       - Normally, the songname will scroll if it's long.  You can disable it
         so it will only scroll when you click & drag on it.

   Right-click on seek bar
     - Displays options to rewind/fastforward 5 seconds.  The left and right
       arrow keys will also rewind/fastforward 5 seconds.

   Right-click on buttons
     - Right-click on buttons for extra options.  The normal function will be
       displayed as well as alternate functions.

     Stuffamp as well as perform the splay command with the parameters given.

     addition to mp3stuff checking.  (Disabling the version check in either
     mp3stuff or Stuffamp will now disable both.)
